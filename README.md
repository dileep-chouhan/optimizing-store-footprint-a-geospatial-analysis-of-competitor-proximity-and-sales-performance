# Optimizing Store Footprint: A Geospatial Analysis of Competitor Proximity and Sales Performance

## Overview

This project analyzes the spatial relationships between store locations, competitor density, demographic data, and sales performance to identify optimal locations for new stores and suggest improvements to existing store strategies.  The analysis leverages geospatial techniques to uncover correlations and patterns that inform strategic business decisions.  The project outputs include a comprehensive analysis printed to the console and visualizations highlighting key findings.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Geopandas (likely, depending on the specific implementation)
* [Other relevant libraries - add as needed]


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   The script will perform the geospatial analysis and generate the output.


## Example Output

The script will print a summary of the analysis to the console, including key findings such as:

* Correlation between competitor density and sales performance.
* Identification of areas with high potential for new store locations based on demographic data and competitor analysis.
* Suggestions for adjustments to existing store strategies based on the analysis.

Additionally, the script will generate visualizations (e.g., maps, charts) saved as image files (e.g., `sales_trend.png`, `competitor_density.png`). These files will be located in the project directory and will provide a visual representation of the key findings.
